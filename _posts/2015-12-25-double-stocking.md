Santa has problems. One of them is how to fill all those stockings hung
with care in the middle of the night without waking up the sleeping
tykes. There's enough work to be done deploying the full-size presents.
How can we make this Christmas tradition less trying?

Inspired by my friend [Brian Christian](http://brian-christian.com/)'s writing
and my extended family's efforts to stuff Christmas stockings without their
children noticing, I regifted a computer science
[algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering) for the Yuletide.
If parents were to buy two sets of Christmas stockings and hang
one set, empty, above the fireplace, they could fill the second set at their
leisure. Then on Christmas Eve, they only have to swap the two sets. Easy.
