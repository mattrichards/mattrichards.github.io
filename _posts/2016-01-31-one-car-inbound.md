The subway car before him is fullâ€”not Tokyo full, but enough that the
straphangers struggle to keep their elbows out of each others' faces. On the
platform, two people stand between him and the open doors. He does not want
them to go in. If they go in, he'll have to decide whether to go in too. If
they go in, he'll have to weigh the struggle of pushing himself into the
passengers nearest the door versus the embarrassment of someone cutting past
him and doing the same. If they go in, he'll be responsible for how late he is
going to be.

In front of him, one of the two takes off her backpack, holds it low, and steps
across the gap. She is attractive and if she smiled at the two business men she
wedged herself between, they'd probably smile back. But she does not smile here.

He looks pleadingly at the remaining one, then glances away before anyone
notices. Through the window, he sees a row of seats occupied solely by a to-go
cup of Panera coffee and a latex glove. There's a foot-wide gap between the
seats and the crowd. _If only someone could clean that up. Even use a
long-sleeve-covered arm and knock the mess to the floor discretely, people
might fill that space._

The other takes a small step toward the doors but before she crosses the
threshold a man wearing a leopard-print carpet swears loudly. The vagrant
walks along the yellow-painted edge of the platform up to the open doors. "Make
room, you candy-ass suckers."

He rocks backwards slightly and exhales.
