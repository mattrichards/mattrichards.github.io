Don't flush masculine products down the toilet.  
The body hair and broad shoulders gum the works.  
Keep them far away from the bidets as well.

Anything macho, any testosterone,  
is a trigger. We had to mix Drano with  
a shot of estrogen after Bill was in.

No trans-masculine or genderfluid stuff  
either. We don't discriminate about this.  
The plumbing is old and very sensitive.
