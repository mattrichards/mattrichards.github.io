If you are in a student's mindset when summoned as a juror, it is easy to
get confused. You are being quizzed. You want to give the right answer.
At first, that seems, in the student's mind, to be the one
that gets you on the jury&mdash;the one that passes the test. Then you realize
you don't want to be here and the right answer becomes the wrong answer.
Finally, you step out of the student's mind, finding the truthful
answer as there is no right answer.
