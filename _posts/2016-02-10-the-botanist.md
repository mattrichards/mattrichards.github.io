He needs the cherry tree to blossom. Right now, it is bare. It's early
March and his grandkids visit in a week. He's standing on the sidewalk
wearing a dull yellow sweater, tan slacks, and sneakers that haven't been white
for six years. In his hand is Suze's hair dryer; its black cord is plugged
into an orange extension cord that is plugged into a green extension cord
that runs from the back of the garage out to the curb. He is working on the
far side of the tree now. He moves the hair dryer from left to right and from
his tip-toes to the lowest branches at shoulder level.

"Suze, could you get the ladder? I'm not gettin' the top."

This might take longer than he thought. He's thinking about bringing out the
space heater and running it overnight. Where did he see it last? It's probably
next to the broken microwave on the shelf above the water heater. Or maybe
under the guest bed. If he runs it the whole night long the electric bill
will be nuts. Still, he promised Sophia the cherry tree would be blooming. The
look in her eyes when she's smiling is worth a hundred utility bills.

This dachshund waddles up to the orange extension cord, sniffs it, and then
over to the open earth around the tree. A young woman is talking into her phone
as she walks with the pooch. She keeps moving but the dog stops and vigorously
smells one of the roots. She's almost to the corner when the dog lifts his leg.
He glares at the dog. Seeing that she's looking something up on her phone now,
he takes the hair dryer and directs it right in the dog's ass. The dachshund
wiggles his tail and runs off towards the woman.

Suze steps out of the garage carrying the kitchen step stool. "Is that my hair
dryer?"
