The units we use to measure computers are dry and overly fastidious: the
kilobyte, the megahertz. They feel metric and, frankly, European, despite
America's central role in this industry. To rectify this fault, I am proposing
a set of Imperial computing units with their own joyous idiosyncrasies.

**Storage**

* Punch – 80 bytes
* Floppy – 18,000 punches
* Jaz – 694 floppies

**Processing**

* Nes – 7 million operations per second
* Cray – 50 Neses
* Wii – 34 Crays

Before we unveil networking, let's pause for a moment to consider how the
existing system handles it. All the units here are in terms of storage
units per second (e.g., MB/s). That's all fine and dandy and actually
convenient in practice, but the Imperial system thinks little of convenience.
Why should such a key facet of modern computing have to ride sidecar to
storage? So, a distinct set of units is in order.

**Networking**

* Net punch – 1 punch per second
* Modem – 45 net punches
* Trunk – 53.6 modems
