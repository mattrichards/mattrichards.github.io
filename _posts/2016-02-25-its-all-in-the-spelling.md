If you call [it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Me_(Whip/Nae_Nae)) that 
"whip nae-nae" song, then it sounds like it's about elder abuse. 
However, if you say "Whip Neigh-Neigh," it becomes the ballad of America's 
first congresshorse, a Washington outsider, who rises through the ranks and 
gets out the vote.
