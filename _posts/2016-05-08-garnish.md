Picture me shaving bison liver treats over the dog's kibble, looking like a waiter in your favorite Italian restaurant working a hunk of *Grana Padano*, his hair dark and curly, distracted only for a second as he recalls the easy laugh of that beautiful young woman who he and his friends walked passed, years before coming to America, on the *Ponte Sisto* above the Tiber River.

That dog has it good.
