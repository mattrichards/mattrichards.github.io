Theseus, our hero, finds himself in a dark and winding hotel room. Running his hand along the wall, he cautiously seeks a light switch. He finds panel after panel, flipping each rocker, but merely turns on the air conditioner. Cursing the chill, he steps forward and trips over a duffle bag on the floor.

Ariadne stirs from her slumber. "What's that?"

"Nothing, go back to sleep." Theseus lifts himself off the tile floor and gets on one knee. "Father Poseidon, please show me the way." As he gropes for the wall, he finds the cord of a hair dryer that Ariadne has used after her evening shower. He follows the cord's course around a wardrobe and arrives at the bathroom door. Inside, he quietly lifts the toilet seat. He notices a fly with the head of a bull alight in the bowl and aims his stream at it, knocking the beast into the water. Satisfied, he flushes and goes back to bed.
