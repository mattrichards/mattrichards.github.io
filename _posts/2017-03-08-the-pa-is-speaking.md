"S.F. police, please report to Montgomery Station. There is a Sleeper on the platform. Repeat, there is a showing of Woody Allen's early, madcap comedy 'Sleeper' happening on the platform. Al, I think you'd enjoy it."

I hear this as I walk down the steps to the platform, passing underneath an ad for a food delivery startup. I am already twenty minutes late. There's a train at the other end of the platform that I will not make, so I don't bother hurrying. But it doesn't pull away. As I get closer, there's a crowd facing the center of the station. In fact, the operator is getting out of the front car, closing the train doors behind her, and joins the throng.

So much for my ten o'clock stand-up meeting.

As the credits roll 80 minutes later, one business man standing in front of me turns to another. "I hear they're playing 'Bananas' next week."

"Oh, the bit with the snake bite is hilarious." He pulls out his smart phone. "Siri, clear my calendar next Wednesday morning."
