Today is Homeless Day presented by   
the American Realtors' Association.   
The first 2,000 fans get a hot meal   
and a shower. A team of valets in   
red windbreakers look after shopping carts   
while the guests stream in and take their seats.

Saint Narragansett sings our national anthem   
wrapped in a gingham blanket against the night's chill,   
fabric bags from Trader Joe's with all she has to her   
name hanging from the back of her wheelchair.   
The ballpark's crowd roars at the high notes and   
her cap fills as it's passed around the dugouts.

Behind the box seats Penobscot Joe sells incense   
by the stick or the rubber-band-wrapped dozen   
at a stand with a handwritten cardboard sign:   
*A hungry traveler seeking only to get home   
Open your heart and no fair offer will be turned down.*   
Brisk business with patchouli and sandalwood.
