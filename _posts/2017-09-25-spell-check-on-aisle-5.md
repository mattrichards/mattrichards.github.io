*She twirls her fork in a plate of priest-stranglers, making a vortex with the noodles.* He lifts his fingers off the keyboard and re-reads the last sentence he wrote. Is *noodle* spelled right? His eyes scan back and forth.   
*noodle*

*noodle   
noodle   
noodle   
noodle*

*noodle

noodle   
noodle*   
Definitely wrong.
