I met a blogger from a bygone land   
Who spoke of a section of metal wall,   
Half buried beside a dry riverbed   
Topped with barbed wire that's started to fall.   
Every few hundred yards stands another slab   
With patches of gold paint amid dull rust.   
From one side of this vast landscape made drab   
A hand had ruled uprooting any trust.   

For there is text that peeks above the earth   
"Behold the wall of GERRYMANDIAS:   
Look on my works, bad hombre, and despair!"   
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay   
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare   
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
