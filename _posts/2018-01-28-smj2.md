As he's transferring the laundry into the washing machine, his eyes happen to catch the tag in a pair of slacks. *Dry clean only*. He pauses for a moment before tossing them in. "I'm calling your bluff."

Two hours later, as he pulls the same pants out of the dryer, he gives them a once over. The color looks the same. There are no noticeable holes or signs of pilling. Seeing a pen on the shelf, he grabs it, crosses out "only" on the tag, and writes "optional" above it.
