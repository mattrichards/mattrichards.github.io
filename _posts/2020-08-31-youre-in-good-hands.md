He is walking down the steps to the sidewalk. On his back is a pack containing

- three diapers,
- a changing mat,
- hand sanitizer,
- a tube of diaper rash ointment,
- a bottle with six ounces of formula,
- two rice crackers,
- a bib,
- a hat,
- sunscreen,
- a rubber ball, and
- a small rubber giraffe.

On his chest is an 11-month-old boy.
