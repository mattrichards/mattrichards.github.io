Chardsy is the creation of Matthew Knight Richards. I am a professional maker
of software, but before that I was an amateur writer and this site is a means
for me to find literature again.

At an art exhibit in Denver, the studies that preceded the masterpieces
inspired me. I liked the idea of cruder work that would help the artist
understand the subject and prepare for a more substantial piece. So, don't
be surprised to see the same events or topics repeated, but from different
perspectives or with different tones.

People say that one should write what one knows, so I'm sure computer
technology will appear in posts here. However, it's a subject that
consumes enough of my time, so I hope to not dwell on it. I will leave it
to others to share their wisdom about computers.

Chardsy is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/).
