Chardsy is the creation of Matthew Knight Richards. I am a professional maker
of software, but before that I was an amateur writer and this site is a means
for me to find literature again.

People say that one should write what one knows, so I'm sure computer
technology will appear in posts here. However, it's a subject that
consumes enough of my time, so I hope to not dwell on it. I will leave it
to others to share their wisdom about computers.

Chardsy is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/).
