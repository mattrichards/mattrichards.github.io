Considering buying me a gift, but not sure what to get me? You've come to the right place. Here are some suggestions.

#### Experiences

* A gift certificate to [18reasons](https://18reasons.org/)

#### Things

* True Detective Season 1 DVD set
* Electric kettle with multiple temperature settings, such as
  - Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp 1.7-Liter Stainless Steel Cordless Electric Kettle
  - Hamilton Beach 41020 Electric Kettle, Stainless Steel
  - Bonavita 1.0L Digital Variable Temperature Gooseneck Kettle
* An HBO Now subscription

This list is by no means complete and I would love to be surprised with something I have not thought of.

I respectly request no gifts of

* whisky - I love the stuff, but am too well stocked already
* cookbooks - I enjoy cooking, but other than a few favorites, I rarely take the time to search through a cookbook to find a recipe. Too many sit idly on my shelves.
